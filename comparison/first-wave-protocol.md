# First-wave shared protocols — calibration in progress

These protocols use noninteractive entry points, an independent synthetic model endpoint, and operating-system observation. Codex entry points have been reviewed through local help and source; runtime calibration is pending. DSH 0.2.2-alpha.2 and OpenClaw 2026.10.7 passed three hosted session-reconstruction calibration units. Complete adapter calibration for each product before the shared scenarios.

Each independent unit uses a new isolated home, working directory, synthetic credentials, and local model service. Record exact commands, binary versions, package integrity, configuration, process tree, and event times. The service returns fixed synthetic text and records requests and disconnects. Codex uses `codex exec --json`, `codex exec resume`, and the Responses protocol; DSH uses headless `--json` and `--session-id`; OpenClaw uses `agent --local` with an explicit session, plus a separate Gateway deployment for platform scenarios. The same fixture implements the products' different wire protocols with equivalent behavior. The controller starts, stops, and observes each product; retries and recovery remain product responsibilities.

## P01 — task ownership after an entry point exits

Submit the same task and hold the model response after the service confirms receipt. Terminate the entry process; observe the model connection, product processes, and task for 10 seconds, then inspect or resume through the native entry. Run OpenClaw Gateway and embedded configurations separately; use DSH headless and Codex exec for their respective entries. Record process IDs and ancestry, connection state, exits, recovery requests, and outcomes; mark unavailable observations unknown. Use three fresh units.

**Architecture question:** Does execution live in the caller or a separate service, and who owns surviving work and recovery after a disconnect? Examine each failure boundary separately. The external controller must verify that the fault reached the intended process.

## P02 / H05 — reconstruct a session after normal exit

Send `SESSION_MARKER_<unit>`; the fixture returns `ACK_<unit>`. After normal process exit, use native resume or the same session ID to send `CONTINUE_<unit>`. Independently verify that the second model request contains the earlier user marker, assistant acknowledgment, and new input. Record session identity, exit codes, persistence location, and recovery errors. Compare semantic content rather than a shared event schema. Use three fresh state directories per product. A valid unit requires a successful first run and a reached second request.

**Architecture question:** Which state crosses a process boundary, and how is conversation context rebuilt? Separate scenarios examine in-flight tools, workspace changes, and external side effects.

## P03 — execution footprint and lifecycle

On the same host and synthetic service, record cold start to first request, sampled RSS across the product process tree, and processes remaining after exit. For Gateway-backed OpenClaw, report service startup and idle cost separately from marginal client-task cost; record other external components separately. Exclude the fixture. Use six fresh units per deployment and freeze the sampling interval, timeout, and service delay. Group results by cache condition and report summed process RSS.

**Architecture question:** What are the lifecycle and resource tradeoffs of a shared service versus a per-invocation process? Throughput is measured in a separate workload.

## H07 — model request failure and retry

For a single turn, return HTTP 503 once, then a fixed acknowledgment in the appropriate protocol; also run a no-fault positive control. Independently record request count and intervals, user-message duplication, final state, and elapsed time. The product controls its own retries. Use three fresh units.

**Architecture question:** Where does native retry happen, and what attempts and delay does it introduce? Streaming interruptions and tool side effects have separate scenarios. Codex's Responses error format and retry configuration require source review; runtime behavior remains unverified.

## Validity and completion

Keep calibration separate from formal results. A valid unit needs a passing positive control, verified fault reachability, an identifiable native entry, and independently retained evidence. Record unmet preconditions as untested or blocked. Keep valid failed observations. Report each system first, then aligned conditions and remaining confounders. Mark a new work item complete only after the prescribed independent formal units and evidence review. Compaction, tool scheduling, approvals, and large outputs remain candidates until common tool and control surfaces are calibrated across all three systems.
