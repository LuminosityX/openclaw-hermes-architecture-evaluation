# Agent Platform and Harness Architecture Evaluation

Architecture research for **Codex, DeepSeek Harness (DSH), and OpenClaw**, across two complementary layers: how a system hosts agent work, and how its harness manages each execution. Six dimensions—reliability, security, performance, cost, extensibility, and observability—apply to both layers.

## Six dimensions, two architecture layers

The platform layer examines how each system hosts and operates agent work. The harness layer examines how it assembles, controls, and recovers an individual run. Each experiment contributes evidence to one or more dimensions.

| Dimension | Platform evaluation | Harness evaluation | Initial work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Reliability** | Failure isolation, state persistence, and deployment recovery | Context retention, execution recovery, and retry behavior | P01, P02, H03, H04, H05, H07, H08 |
| **Security** | State and credential ownership, access boundaries, and isolation | Authorization scope and consistency between approval and execution | P02, P05, H11 |
| **Performance** | Throughput, concurrency, and resource contention | Tool scheduling, execution latency, and dependency handling | P03, H08 |
| **Resource & cost** | Idle footprint and marginal cost per task | Context processing, retry overhead, and model usage | P03, H03, H04, H07 |
| **Extensibility** | Entry-point integration and operational control | Component extension and responsibility boundaries | P04, H14 |
| **Observability** | Fault visibility and diagnosis across system boundaries | Reconstruction of approvals, tool effects, and recovery | P01, P04, H05, H11, H17 |
